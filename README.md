# CodeSamples

This repository contains samples of code I've written from different projects I've worked on.

Currently, there are code samples from a game I worked on called Recursion Error. If you would like to see what the game is about check out the [website](https://cyberduckcollectivestudio.wordpress.com/) or my [itch page](https://dakostthedwarf.itch.io/) to try the game out.
