# Recursion Error - Level System

## Files

This folder contains code that I wrote for a level system in the game Recursion Error. The SceneChanger script is where all of the code for the system to function is while the BattleManager script is where all of the variables kept when loading new scenes are contained.

## Description

This system starts the player in a specific area and randomly chooses the order of levels the player plays through. Once all of the levels in the area are completed it moves the player onto the next area. This system allows for the addition of new levels in an area without making any changes to the code.
